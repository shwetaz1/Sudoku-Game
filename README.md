# Sudoku-Game
In this project i have used pygame, pyttsx3 Libraries of python.
Sudoku is a puzzle in which missing numbers are to be filled into a 9 by 9 grid of squares which are 
subdivided into 3 by 3 boxes so that every row, every column, and every box contains the numbers 1 
through 9.
Sudoku rules for beginners:
1. Only use the numbers 1 to 9,
2. Avoid trying to guess the solution to the puzzle,
3. Only use each number once in each row, column, & grid,
4. Use the process of elimination as a tactic,
5. Use cross-hatching and penciling in techniques.
